# Earth-Mars Launch Window Calculator

This project provides a tool to calculate the next Earth-to-Mars launch window based on a given target date. It consists of both frontend and backend components.

## Overview

- **Backend**: Implemented using Python and Flask, the backend performs astronomical calculations to determine optimal launch windows. Detailed setup instructions and documentation are available in the `backend` folder's README.

- **Frontend**: Built with Vue.js, the frontend offers an interactive interface for users to input dates and view the calculated launch windows. Instructions for running and customizing the frontend can be found in the `frontend` folder's README.
